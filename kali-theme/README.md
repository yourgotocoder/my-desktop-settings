## Kali-like theme
I think Kali's theme is beautiful, thus I will be replicating that for my terminal.
- Install zsh first
- Then install some tools to improve your zsh experience.
  - sudo apt install zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions
  - sudo apt install fonts-firacode gnome-tweaks
- Next clone some color schemes and themes
  - git clone https://github.com/linuxopsys/ubuntu-to-kali-terminal.git
  - cd ubuntu-to-kali-terminal
  - Next, extract the compressed files, once you have extracted all the files you will notice a new directory named "usr" in your current working directory.
    - tar -xvf color-schemes.tar
    - tar -xvf kali-dark-theme.tar
- Next change your default terminal from bash to zsh using the command `chsh -s $(which zsh)`
- Lets customise the zsh shell now
  - Remove any zsh configs that might exist by doing `rm ~/.zshrc`
  - Now create an empty zsh config file using `touch ~/.zshrc`
  - Now go to this [link](https://pastebin.com/rhrWSiaL) and copy paste the config setting.
  - Activate the config file using the source command, `source ~/.zshrc`
- Activating the themes
  - Install gnome-tweaks and chrome-gnome-shell. 
  - Once gnome-tweaks is installed, open gnome-tweaks and change the theme to Kali from the list of options in the Appearance tab.
  - You will have to install the gnome shell integration extension from the Chrome web store in order to change the shell settings.
