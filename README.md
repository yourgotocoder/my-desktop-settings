# The philosophy behind my setup
Configuring a PC for my software engineering need is something I do often enough that I dont't want to have to do it over and over again, so I think I
should document my process and hopefully I can keep improving my setup.

## Ubuntu 22.04 (My preferred Operating System)
I like linux over windows like a lot of developers. The limitations of the hardware that I had as I was learning how to code forced me to learn 
linux. It is way less resource hungry and the stability of windows(***unwanted updates***) was a constant 
issue that pretty much forced me to move to linux.
I could have tried learning something more complicated like Arch linux (*maybe I'll learn it in the future*) but Ubuntu provides the stability and ease that something like
Arch cannot provide me. The pacakges available through (***apt & snap***) for Ubuntu has almost all the tools that I use in my 
development environment and thus it allows me to quickly setup my development environment. Plus it is linux, so I can customise it however I like.


### Replicating my setup
One of the best features about Linux is that I can automate a lot of tasks using ".sh" scripts. All of the tools I install on my system
can be installed using the `initial-setup.sh` file and a better description for all my tools is available in the initial-setup folder.
